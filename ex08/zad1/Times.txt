Dla wariantu NUMBERS wyniki czasowe są znacznie gorsze niż dla wartiantu BLOCK,
najpewniej jest to wynikiem przechodzenia całej tablicy przez każdy wątek w poszukiwaniu pikseli
ze swojego przedziału.
Dla większej liczby wątków całkowity czas wykoniania wydłuża się ze względu na
tworzenie i kończenie się każdego z wątków.
